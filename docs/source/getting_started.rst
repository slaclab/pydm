Getting Started with PyDM
=========================

Installation
------------

There are a few different ways to install PyDM.  The easiest way to install it
from scratch is probably using the Anaconda system.  If you have an existing
python environment, and want to install PyDM for use with that, you can do that
with pip.

Installing with Anaconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After installing Anaconda (see https://www.anaconda.com/download/), create a new
environment for PyDM::
  
  $ conda create -n pydm-environment python=3.6 pyqt=5 pip numpy scipy six psutil pyqtgraph -c conda-forge
  $ source activate pydm-environment
  
Once the environment is setup, continue on with the instructions in the `Installing
with PIP`_ section below.

Installing with PIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyDM is not currently part of the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you'll have to
first `download a release of PyDM <https://github.com/slaclab/pydm/releases/>`_,
or clone PyDM's git repository::

  $ git clone https://github.com/slaclab/pydm.git
  
After you download PyDM, enter the directory where you saved it, and run::

  $ pip install .[all]
  
This will download and install all the necessary dependencies, then will install 
PyDM.

Setting Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyDM has several environment variables that let you configure its behavior, and
where it looks for certain types of files.  To ensure these variables are always
set, you probably want to add them to your shell startup file (like ~/.bashrc, if you
are using bash).

Designer Plugin Path
++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to use Designer to build displays with PyDM widgets, you'll need to
add the PyDM install location to the PYQTDESIGNERPATH environment variable.  This
directory might be buried pretty deep, depending on how Python is installed on your
system.  For example, mine lives at '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pydm/'.

Default Data Source
+++++++++++++++++++

PyDM lets you get data from multiple data sources.  To accomplish this, all
addresses are prefixed by a 'scheme', much like a URL.  For example, the
EPICS plugin that comes with PyDM registers the scheme 'ca', and to specify
an address to a PV, you'd write 'ca://PVNAME'.  Many sites use one data 
source primarily, and if you'd like to avoid always writing out the same scheme,
you can set the PYDM_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL environment variable.  For example,
to use the EPICS plugin by default, set PYDM_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL to 'ca'.  Now
you can use 'PVNAME' as an address without specifying that you want to use
channel access.

Troubleshooting PyDM Widgets in Designer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Qt Designer to see the PyDM widgets, the PyQt Designer Plugin needs to be
installed.  This is usually done as part of the PyQt install process, but some
package managers (like homebrew on OSX) don't install the plugin when PyQt is
installed.  In that case, you'll probably need to install PyQt from source.
Follow the directions from the PyQt documentation: http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html#building-and-installing-from-source

Building Your First Display with Qt Designer
--------------------------------------------

Once you have PyDM installed, you can start making displays.  The easiest way
to make a display is to use Qt Designer, which is Qt's drag-and-drop tool for
building user interfaces.  Once you open Designer, you'll be greeted by a mostly
blank screen, with a list of widgets on the left, and a property inspector on the
right.

   the widget list on the left.
   
To make a new PyDM display, go to File->New..., then choose to build a new Widget.

.. note::
    All PyDM displays must have a Widget for the base - if you try to use MainWindow, your
    display will not work properly.
    
Now you should see a blank form on which you can drag widgets.  Drag a PyDMLabel 
(in the 'PyDM Display Widgets' section) onto the form.  On the right side of the
screen, you can see all the properties for the widget.  Most of these properties
are for the basic QLabel widget that PyDMLabel is based on, and control the label's
appearance and size (things like the font).  At the bottom of the properties list
are the PyDM-specific properties.

.. figure:: pydm_properties.png
   :scale: 33 %
   :alt: Screenshot showing the PyDMLabel's properties.

   The PyDMLabel's properties are highlighted in red.

Lets fill in the 'channel' property for this label, which will connect it to a source
of data.  PyDM comes with a Python-based IOC which is useful for testing widgets out.
We'll use one of the PVs supplied by the testing IOC.  Set the label's 'channel' property
to 'ca://MTEST:Float'.  Once that is done, go to File->Save... and save the .ui file
somewhere.

We can test the display in PyDM by first running the testing IOC.  Open up a new
terminal and run the command::

  $ pydm-testing-ioc
  
to launch the IOC.  Once the IOC is running, run the command::
  
  $ pydm <your file name>
  
with the .ui file you just saved.  This will open your display in PyDM.  If everything
works correctly, you should see a label with the text '0.000'.  This value will update
whenever the MTEST:Float PV updates.  You can test this by using 'caput' at the terminal
to change the value of MTEST:Float, and observing the label on the display.

You now know almost all you need to build simple displays!  At this point, the
best thing you can do is play around with the various widgets and their properties.
For example, try adding a slider to your display and connect it to the same PV - you
should see the label change as the slider moves around.

Once you've become comfortable with building displays in Designer, you should
investigate the system for writing your own displays using Python code (see 
:doc:`/scripted_displays`).
