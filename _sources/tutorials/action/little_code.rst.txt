Adding Code into the Main Display
=================================

.. important::

    * Make sure the PCASpy tutorial server is :ref:`running <Setup>`

For this particular application it would be of interest to not only see the beam
image on the screen, but to also calculate the maximum point on the image and display
the coordinates in a label.

To do so, we will need to add some Python code to our main screen developed at
the :ref:`Main` section.

Since we already have the screen designed in the UI file, we can re-use it in
our Python-based display, and hook up code to interact with widgets.

This is accomplished by subclassing `pydm.Display` (See :ref:`Display` for more details).

* **Step 1.**

   Open a new text file.  The first thing that we will do is add the imports
   needed for the code that will follow.

   .. code-block:: python

       import time
       from os import path
       from pydm import Display
       from scipy.ndimage.measurements import maximum_position

* **Step 2.**

  Let's create our Python class that will inherit from ``Display`` (See :ref:`Display`).

  .. code-block:: python

      class BeamPositioning(Display):

          def __init__(self, parent=None, args=None, macros=None):
              super().__init__(parent=parent, args=args, macros=None)
              # Attach our custom process_image method
              self.ui.imageView.process_image = self.process_image
              # Hook up to the newImageSignal so we can update
              # our widgets after the new image is done
              self.ui.imageView.newImageSignal.connect(self.show_blob)
              # Store blob coordinate
              self.blob = (0, 0)

          def ui_filename(self):
              # Point to our UI file
              return 'main.ui'

          def ui_filepath(self):
              # Return the full path to the UI file
              return path.join(path.dirname(path.realpath(__file__)), self.ui_filename())

  Breaking the class constructor code into pieces, we have:

  #. Replaced the default ``PyDMImageView`` method ``process_image`` with our
     own custom method.
  #. Hooked up our ``show_blob`` method to the ``newImageSignal`` that is emitted
     by the ``PyDMImageView`` every time a new image is displayed.
  #. Initialized the ``self.blob`` variable with `(0, 0)`.
  #. Implemented a ``ui_filename`` method returning the name of the ``UI`` file to be used and
     compose the screen.
  #. Implemented a ``ui_filepath`` method returning the full path to the ``ui_filename`` so PyDM
     can properly load it.

  * **Step 2.1.**

    Add code to the ``process_image`` callback method so we can calculate the
    blob position.

    .. important::

       The ``process_image`` method is defined in the ``PyDMImageView`` widget
       and more information about it can be found at the
       `PyDMImage widget documentation page <https://slaclab.github.io/pydm/widgets/image.html>`_.

       Since this method runs in a separated ``QThread``, we shouldn't
       manipulate widgets in this method, since this code runs outside of the 
       **Qt Main Thread**.

    .. code-block:: python

        def process_image(self, new_image):
            # Consider the maximum as the Blob since we have only
            # one.
            self.blob = maximum_position(new_image)
            # Send the original image data to the image widget
            return new_image

    In ``process_image`` we call the scipy method `maximum_position <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.measurements.maximum_position.html>`_
    to calculate the coordinates for the maximum spot and save it to ``self.blob``.
    At the end, this method returns the unmodified image, which the ImageView
    will display.  If you'd like to manipulate the image before displaying it,
    you can do so in this method, and return the manipulated version.

  * **Step 2.2.**

    Add code to the ``show_blob`` method so we update the ``QLabel`` with the
    new blob position calculated in ``process_image``.

    .. code-block:: python

        def show_blob(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # If we have a blob, present the coordinates in label
            if self.blob != (0, 0):
                blob_txt = "Blob Found:"
                blob_txt += " ({}, {})".format(self.blob[1], self.blob[0])
            else:
                # If no blob was found, present the "Not Found" message
                blob_txt = "Blob Not Found"
            # Update the label text
            self.ui.lbl_blobs.setText(blob_txt)


* **Step 3.**

  Save this file as ``main.py``.

  .. warning::
     For this tutorial it is important to use this file name as it will be referenced
     at the other sections. If you change it please remember to also change in the
     other steps when referenced.

* **Step 4.**

  Test the Main Screen:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pydm main.py

     :scale: 75 %
     :align: center
