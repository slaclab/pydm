This example demonstrates how macro variables are cascaded through
nested embedded displays.  The first embedded display defines a 
variable "a", which is sent to a second embedded display, which
defines another variable "b".  The second display embeds a python
based display which shows the sum of the macro variables "a" and "b".

To run this example, open 'nested_embedded_windows.ui'.
