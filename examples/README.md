# pydm-examples: Python Display Manager Examples
[PyDM](https://github.com/slaclab/pydm) is a Python-Qt based framework for building user interfaces for control systems.  The goal is to provide a no-code, drag-and-drop system to make simple screens, as well as a straightforward python framework to build complex applications.

# Prerequisites for the examples
* Python 3.10+
* pydm
* Qt 5.7 or higher
* PyQt5 >= 5.7 or PySide6 6.9
* pcaspy (Optional)
pcaspy is needed for the `pydm-testing-ioc` used in most of the examples.

# Running the Examples
There are various examples of some of the features of the display manager.
To launch a particular display run 'pydm <filename>'.

There is a 'home' display in the examples directory with buttons to launch all the examples:
run 'pydm home.ui'

Documentation for the examples is yet to come.
Documentation for PyDM is available at http://slaclab.github.io/pydm/.  Documentation is somewhat sparse right now, unfortunately.

# Starting the testing IOC
The testing IOC provides EPICS PVs for use on most of the examples here provided.
As of now the PVs are generated using [pcaspy](https://pcaspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for instructions on how to install this package please refer 
to the package [documentation](https://pcaspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

After having the dependency installed run the command:

```sh
./testing_ioc/pydm-testing-ioc
```

You may need to check the EPICS address and server port to ensure your local system can find the simulated PVs. Use the following procedure from the command line to identify the EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT and add to your EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST:

```sh
env | grep EPICS_CA
export EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST="${EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST} (your local host):(EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT)"
```

Then run the testing_ioc as above.
